- Basic types of graphs
    - Undirected graph : ()-()-()
    - Directed graph : ()->()->()<-()
- It consists of : Nodes/vertex,edge 
- Cycle : If we can travel from one point of a graph and can come back to it. Type: Directed/Undirected cyclic/acyclic graph
- Path : all the node covered while travelling form 1 to n. Only possible if the nodes are connected
- Degrees
    - For UG : No of edges that are connected to a node. Total degree = 2 * no.of edges (as every edge connects two node)
    - For DG : The no.of edges coming to the ()<- is called indegree and ()-> is called outdegree.
- Connected Components : Different graphs that might not be connected but act as a single graph.

Dijsktra (UG): Don't work for -ve weights and cycles
Bellman Ford (DG): Detect negative cycles
Flloyd Warshal (DG): Works for shortest node form path a to path b
